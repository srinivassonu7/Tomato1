## Introduction

This project aims to classify tomato leaf diseases using machine learning techniques. It can help farmers and researchers identify diseases early, allowing for more targeted treatments and improved crop yield.

## Features

- Classification of tomato leaf diseases into multiple classes.
- User-friendly web interface for inference.
- Detailed model evaluation metrics.
- Easily extensible for custom datasets and models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
- GPU for faster training (optional but recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/srinivassonu7/Tomato1.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Tomato1
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Preprocess your tomato leaf images and organize them into appropriate directories (e.g., train, validation, test).

2. Train the model:

   ```
   python train.py --data /path/to/dataset --model resnet50
   ```

3. Evaluate the model:

   ```
   python evaluate.py --model /path/to/saved/model --data /path/to/test/dataset
   ```

4. Make predictions:

   ```
   python predict.py --model /path/to/saved/model --image /path/to/image.jpg
   ```

## Data

You can use your own tomato leaf disease dataset or find open datasets online. Organize your data into the following directory structure:

```
dataset/
|-- train/
|   |-- class1/
|   |-- class2/
|   |-- ...
|-- valid/
|   |-- class1/
|   |-- class2/
|   |-- ...
|-- test/
|   |-- class1/
|   |-- class2/
|   |-- ...
```

## Training

- To train the model, run the `train.py` script, specifying the dataset directory and the desired model architecture.

## Evaluation

- Evaluate the trained model using the `evaluate.py` script, providing the path to the saved model and the test dataset.
